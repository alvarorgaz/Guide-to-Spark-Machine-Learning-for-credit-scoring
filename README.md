**Author:** I am Álvaro Orgaz Expósito, a Statistics student at UPC-UB (Barcelona, Spain) and this is my bachelor's degree thesis.

**Advisors:** Ana María Pérez Marín, Catalina Bolancé Losilla

**Department:** Econometrics, Statistics and Applied Economics

**Academic year:** 2017-2018

**Abstract:** 

This bachelor’s degree thesis aims to develop a predictive analytics guide for credit fraud detection which combine theory and practice using the *Big Data* engine *Spark*.

The main objectives of the theoretical part are introducing the credit sector and doing research about the theory of most common algorithms used nowadays in the areas of *machine learning*, *artificial intelligence* and predictive analytics. The main aims of the practical part are applying the studied algorithms for predicting the probability of default with a dataset of customer characteristics and comparing the predictive behaviour between models.

In conclusion, this thesis will provide the necessary information for developing a predictive analytics project, from the business problem definition to the application of the optimal model.

**Code:**

The project has been developed in R mainly using libraries *sparklyr* and *SparkR*.
